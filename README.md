Asoft Front End React

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Asoft is an application template for Next.js based on the popular Next.js framework with new App Router. 

First, run the development server:

npm run dev


Open [http://localhost:3000] with your browser to see the result.

## Integration with Existing Next.js Applications

Only the folders related to the layout need to be moved into your project. Integration of pages involves moving the files under those folders. Make sure that the using page is defined under the related group layout.
